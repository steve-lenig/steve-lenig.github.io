                <h2>Sixth thing 3rd for me! entry -¥-</h2>
                <p>
                   Hey, I'm getting help so that I can write whatever the hell I want, 
                   and it'll let me do that so I can say hello like, THIS!
                </p>
                </p>
                   I intend to get to many things, but on April 27th (my favorite number) 
                   I am at an art show here in beautiful Austin, Texas!
                   It's the 16th annual Sunset Valley Art Festival!
                   I will find the address. Hang on, 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I haven't gone out to show people these in person in 13 years, 
                    and think this will be very fun! You'll know somebody who will 
                    want one of these in your life!
                    You,ll see! the blavk light function is so cool. it's too bad I have
                     to do that manually. Anyhow, Fun!
                </p>

                <h2>Fifth entry -¥-</h2>
                <p>
                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
                    pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete 
                    account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
                    explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
                </p>
                <img src="img/mazes/Piranna.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>
                    No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
                    but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
                    encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there 
                    anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because 
                    it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and 
                    pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which 
                    of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some 
                    advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who 
                    chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who 
                    avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
