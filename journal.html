                <h2>Sixth thing 3rd for me! entry -¥-</h2>
                <p>
                   Hey, I'm getting help so that I can write whatever the hell I want, 
                   and it'll let me do that so I can say hello like, THIS!
                </p>
                </p>
                   I intend to get to many things, but on April 27th (my favorite number) 
                   I am at an art show here in beautiful Austin, Texas!
                   It's the 16th annual Sunset Valley Art Festival!
                   I will find the address. Hang on, 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I haven't gone out to show people these in person in 13 years, 
                    and think this will be very fun! You'll know somebody who will 
                    want one of these in your life!
                    You,ll see! the blavk light function is so cool. it's too bad I have
                     to do that manually. Anyhow, Fun!
                </p>

                <h2>Fifth entry -¥-</h2>
                <p>
                    Amidst the dusty desert plains, where heatwaves dance like specters in 
                    the sun, we find ourselves amidst the cacophony of the Mint 400 motorcycle 
                    race. Motorcycle engines roar like lions in the jungle, their riders clad 
                    in a mishmash of leather and denim, a motley crew of misfits and rebels. 
                    Amidst the chaos, the air is thick with the smell of gasoline and sweat, 
                    a heady cocktail that invades the senses. Zipping past in a blur of motion, 
                    the motorcycles become streaks of color against the barren landscape. 
                    Every twist and turn of the track is a gamble with fate, a roll of the 
                    dice in the game of life. 
                </p>

                    Keeping pace with the action, we're swept up 
                    in the frenzy, our hearts pounding with excitement. In the midst of it 
                    all, we find ourselves questioning the very fabric of reality, lost in a 
                    haze of dust and adrenaline. Navigating through the madness, we're reminded 
                    of the raw, untamed spirit of humanity, a force to be reckoned with. Gazing 
                    out into the vast expanse of desert, we're struck by the sheer absurdity of 
                    it all, a surreal spectacle that defies explanation.
