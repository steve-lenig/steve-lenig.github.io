How to Add a New Journal Entry

Follow these steps to add a new journal entry to your journal.html file:

1. Open SourceTree
    • Select "steve-lenig.github.io" repo tab
        ◦ If you cant find the repo, try "File -> Open" to look for it
        ◦ If you still cant find it, you can "File -> Clone" with this URL:
          https://github.com/steve-lenig/steve-lenig.github.io.git
    • Hit the "Pull" button to get the latest changes

2. Open the journal.html file
    • Open in VisualStudio Code

3. Find the "journal-content" div
    • Look for a line that says <div class="journal-content">

4. Paste in the template entry below, right underneath the "journal-content" div

            <div class="journal-entry">
                <div class="caption">(April 5 2024 21:10 CST)</div>
                <h2>Journal Title Goes here!</h2>
                <p>
                   This is paragraph one!
                </p>
                <p>
                   This is paragraph two!
                </p>
                <hr />
            </div>

5. Replace the Date part "(April 5 2024 21:10 CST)" with the current date and time

6. Replace the "Journal Title Goes here!" with the new entry's title

7. Replace the paragraphs with the journal entry text
    •  You can add more paragraphs by copying the <p> ... </p> blocks 

8. (Optional) Add images to the journal entry:
    •  Put the image into the "img/journal" folder
    •  Copy this example into the journal entry, and replace the "imagename.jpg" with the file name
    
      <img src="img/journal/imagename.jpg" alt="imagename">

    • To add an image from the web to the journal entry, replace the scr="..." to have the image URL
    
      <img src="https://www.website/imageurl" alt="imagename">

9. (Optional) Add links to the journal entry:
    • Copy this example into the journal entry, and replace the "https://..." with the link URL, and "link text" with the text you want linked
        
            <a href="https://www.sunsetvalley.org/home/">
                link text
            </a>

    • You can use an image instead of link text as well:

            <a href="https://www.sunsetvalley.org/home/">
                <img src="https://www.sunsetvalley.org/home/showpublishedimage/1514/638462899020970000" alt="image">
            </a>

10. Make sure that after your done editing, the "<hr />" is still the last item, like where it is in the example in step 4.

11. Save the file

12. Preview changes by clicking on "index.html", and click the "Show Preview" button to see the site Preview
